pyrove - Python bindings for the rove C++ math and geometry library

This package provides Python bindings for the rove C++ library, which includes:
- Vector math (vec2, vec3, vec4)
- Matrix transformations (mat3, mat4)
- Quaternions
- Geometric primitives (ray, line, plane, triangle, sphere, capsule)
- Bounding volumes (AABB, OBB)
- Collision detection
- Pathfinding (A*)
- Heightfield terrain
